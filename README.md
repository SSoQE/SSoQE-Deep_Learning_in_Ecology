# Deep Learning in Ecology üß†üçÑ

This exercise conveys the basic setup, training, validation and evaluation procedure for deep neural networks. It targets on an ecology-trained audience and therefore, may be simplifying and not always technically comprehensive. The pre-setup deep learning model was implemented with pytorch in python and uses a small data set to ensure that all participants can run the model on their own computers. The model design is simple, but enables participants to tweak essential hyperparameters and observe changes in the performance of the model. Especially the code was programmed together with ChatGPT. If participants have any questions after the course, they can seek support from ChatGPT or any other AI tool **while keeping in mind to critically reflect and question AI answers.**
